# dplyr_FERG
This is a tutorial for the popular dplyr package in R, prepared for the Freshwater Ecology Research Group at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand. 

The pdf and source code (.Rmd file) are both available. Feel free to download / share, or modify source code for your own tutorials, programming, etc. 

This is my first attempt at writing an R tutorial, and my first time using Rmarkdown. Any feedback or comments are welcome. 

Happy coding
